#week 10 first week of project: chose to create a web application for the project and started doing research on the web application by using python crash course text book as well as outside research 
#spring break progress: we started working on the web application but we struggled and spun our wheels for a while while we were installing pip
#week 12: We kept trying to install pip and get our web application code to run but we weren't able to figure it out. We kept trying and went to a sample project on git hub but we still couldn't get it to work
#week 13: We kept working on the webesite but didn't seem to be making any progress and felt like we were spinning our wheels. We decided to change directions and stop working on the web application and we completely switched directions and started working on a game. We looked on google for some ideas as well as python crash course for ideas and we looked for ideas that were interesting to us
#week 14: We decided on a game that was interesting but still seemed to be simple enough where we could complete the code within a few weeks since we did lose a few weeks working on the web application. The game we decided to make has a red block that can be moved around by the cursor and used to take out the white blocks
#week 15: The next step we took was adding a timer as well as different levels of the game as the player took out more white blocks.
#Week 16: We figured out how to add the timer and the different levels but then we wanted to make it possible to lose the game. This was very challenging for us and we were never able to fully figure out how to add a timer that made there a way to lose the game
